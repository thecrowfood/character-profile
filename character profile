      within these boxes, i need to make smaller boxes.  these smaller boxes will have information about the character in other timelines.
      to the right of the smaller boxes, i will also put an image.  if the other versions of the character are important enough to have their own character page,
      it should link there.

      this box will use the exact same code as the other one, it will just be used for a different purpose.  this box will show other characters that this one
      has a relationship with.  the smaller text boxes will give a description of how they know each other etc. and an image like the other column.
