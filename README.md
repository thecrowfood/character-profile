# character-profile

<p>erm im making a character profile template.  like the stuff you see on toyhouse (if anyone is an online art nerd), but to satisfy my own needs.  my characters usually have multiple versions and timelines, so it can be hard to organize.  this template includes space to put basic information about your characters as well as including a space for different versions of the character and a a space to list relationships.  enjoy, i am terrible at coding. </p>
